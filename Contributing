# Contributing to Project LENS

Project LENS is an experimental research and pilot initiative. Contributions are welcome only insofar as they support clarity, rigor, and evidence-gathering.

## How to Contribute

Contributions typically take the form of:
- Clarifying documentation
- Identifying ambiguities or contradictions
- Proposing narrowly scoped improvements
- Supplying evidence that challenges existing assumptions

Before contributing, contributors are expected to:
- Read the Project LENS Charter
- Understand the scope and non-goals of the project
- Accept that not all reasonable contributions will be accepted

## Review Philosophy

Project LENS prioritizes:
- Clarity over cleverness
- Rigor over enthusiasm
- Evidence over opinion
- Stability over velocity

Changes may be rejected even if they are technically correct, well-written, or popular.

## Authority and Decision-Making

Final decision authority rests with designated maintainers.

Discussion does not imply consensus.  
Contribution does not imply ownership.

## Participation

Participation is informal, voluntary, and may be limited or ended at any time.
