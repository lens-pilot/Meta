## Decision Making

- Substantive decisions are documented in repositories via issues, pull requests, or committed documents.
- Informal discussions may occur elsewhere, but outcomes must be recorded in GitHub to be considered official.

## Communication Norms

- Direct messages and off-platform conversations are discouraged for decision-making.
